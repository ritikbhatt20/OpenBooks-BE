# OpenBooks Smart Contract Integration with Nest.js Backend

This README provides detailed instructions for integrating the OpenBooks Escrow Smart Contract with a Nest.js backend. It includes explanations of the integration process, API endpoints, and code examples.

## Overview

The integration of the OpenBooks Escrow Smart Contract with a Nest.js backend facilitates the management of book rentals through secure transactions and seamless communication between the frontend and the blockchain.

## Integration Process

### 1. Installation

Ensure you have Node.js and Nest.js installed on your system. Clone the OpenBooks repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone <openbooks_repo_url>
cd openbooks
npm install
2. Smart Contract Setup
Integrate the provided Rust smart contract into your Solana blockchain environment. Deploy the contract to a Solana network and obtain the program ID.

3. Nest.js Backend Configuration
Solana Service
The SolanaService class in solana.service.ts handles interactions with the Solana blockchain. It establishes a connection, initializes the program, and defines methods for invoking smart contract functions.

Solana Controller
The SolanaController class in solana.controller.ts defines API endpoints for interacting with the smart contract. It receives requests, validates input, and calls corresponding methods in the SolanaService.

Solana Module
The SolanaModule in solana.module.ts integrates the controller and service into the Nest.js application.

4. API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available for interacting with the smart contract:

Request Rent: Initiates a rental request.
Accept Rent: Accepts a rental request and initiates the rental agreement.
Return Book: Finalizes the rental agreement and returns the book.
Code Explanation
solana.service.ts
The SolanaService class establishes a connection to the Solana blockchain using the provided wallet keypair.
It initializes the program with the provided program ID and defines methods for invoking smart contract functions.
Each method corresponds to a smart contract function and handles parameter validation and RPC calls.
solana.controller.ts
The SolanaController class defines API endpoints for interacting with the smart contract.
Each endpoint corresponds to a smart contract function and receives input from HTTP requests.
It validates input data and calls the corresponding method in the SolanaService to invoke the smart contract function.
Usage
Start the Nest.js server and make HTTP requests to the defined API endpoints to interact with the smart contract.
